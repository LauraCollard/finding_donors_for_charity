# Supervised learning project: finding donors for *CharityML*

In this project, we will employ several supervised algorithms to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. We will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Our goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).

*This project was completed as part of Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree.*


**Skills**: Python, Scikit-learn, AdaBoost, Support Vector Machine, Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier, GridSearchCV
